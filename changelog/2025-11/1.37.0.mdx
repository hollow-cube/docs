## Additions

#### Added Set Variable Action
> With these, you can set a decimal number to a name that can be used for other actions.
> This action, unlike others, uses the Molang expression language, so instead of being provided buttons with add, sub, and set,
> you get to use an expression to set the variable. For example, if you have a variable named `result` and you have the expression as `variable.result + 1`, it will increment it by one each time it's run. But maybe you want more than just addition. In such cases,
> you can use other variables to affect `result`, for example, `variable.one + variable.two` 
> will make it so the `result` variable will be the sum of variables `one` and `two`.

#### Added Action Requirements
> With variables alone, it's not much, so we've also made it so you can set a requirement for a plate or region.
> Just like the new set variable action, this is also a Molang expression, but instead of resolving to a number, it must resolve to a true or false. 
> You can use the variables set in the new action for the requirements.
> 
> An example of this is if you set the requirement to `variable.result > 5`, then to activate the plate/region, the player must have a variable in their state that is greater than 5.
> 
> You can also optionally set a requirement message, or by default it will have its own; you can also disable such a message as well for more complex maps.

#### Added Variable Placeholders To Chat Action
> You can also use the variables in chat actions. Simply write `<variable:name/>` and it will insert the variable into the chat message.
> You can also use additional arguments like `<variable:name:percent:100/>`, which will format the inserted text as a percentage with 
> the last argument `100` being what it's out of.

> You can find out more about Molang and what you can do with it on Microsoft's documentation 
> <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/molang/syntax-guide>
> Do note, though, that some more advanced stuff is unsupported.
