## Additions

#### Added set variable action
> With these you can set a decimal number to a name which can be used for other actions.
> This action unlike others use the Molang expression language so instead of being provided buttons with add, sub, and set
> you get to use an expression to set the variable, for example if you have a variable named`result` and you have the expression as `variable.result + 1`  it will increment it by one each time its ran, but maybe you want more than just addition, you can use other variables to effect `result` for example `variable.one + variable.two` 
> will make it so the `result` variable will be the sum of variable `one` and `two`.

#### Added action requirements
> With variables alone its not much, but now you can set a requirement for a plate or region.
> Like the new set variable action this is also a Molang expression but instead of resolving to a number it must resolve to a true or false, you can use the variables set in the new action for the requirements.
> 
> An example of this is if you set the requirement to `variable.result > 5` this will require to activate the plate/region the player must have a variable in their state this is greater than 5.
> 
> You can also optionally set a requirement message or by default it will have its own, you can also disable such a message as well for more complex maps.

#### Added variable placeholders to chat action
> You can also use the variables in chat actions as such you can do `<variable:name/>` and it will insert the variable into the chat message.
> You can also use the additional arguments like `<variable:name:percent:100/>` which will format the inserted text as a percentage with the last argument `100` being what its out of.

> You can find out more about Molang and what you can do with it on Microsoft's documentation <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/molang/syntax-guide>
> Do note some more advanced stuff is unsupported
